Stone Summit is the rock-climbing gym that I belong to in Atlanta.  Due to COVID, they restricted the number of guests allowed and implemented a reservation system.  Climbers (like me) have to book slots now for the priviledge of entering of the facility.  The reservation portal allows users to book slots exactly a week before date/time of the slot.  Much to my chargin, these slots get booked very quicklyand force me to be super vigilante about booking slots right as they open.  But not any more!  I have created a tool that will sign me up for slots as soon as they open!  Using Selenium in Python, I wrote a script to programmitically select a slot and fill out the necessary booking form.  With Lambda Functions in AWS, I can have my script run as soon as the slot I want opens.  No more having to do it myself!
